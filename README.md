## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is a challenge to test  HTML & CSS skills. IT is a step up from smaller projects to build responsive layouts. Here's a snippet of a CSS code where I used Flexbox.

```css
body {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to learn more about HTML an CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand Flexbox
